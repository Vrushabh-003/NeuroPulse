# Social Anxiety Prediction System

This project applies data science and machine learning techniques to analyze
behavioral, lifestyle, and psychological factors influencing social anxiety.

## Objective
To predict social anxiety levels (1–10) using a Kaggle dataset and deploy
the trained model as a web-based application.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Model Used
- Gradient Boosting Regressor (Best Performing)

## Deployment
The model is deployed using Streamlit, allowing real-time anxiety level
prediction based on user inputs.

## Disclaimer
This application is intended for educational and awareness purposes only
and should not be used as a clinical diagnostic tool.
